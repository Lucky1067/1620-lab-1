    <p> (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. 
    It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the 
    web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web 
    developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which 
    you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make 
    it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content 
    into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  
    For example, consider the following line of text:
</p>
</body>
